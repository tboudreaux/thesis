The arguments that indicate that the solar dynamo is an alpha-omega dynamo of the Babcock-Leighton type are then shortly reviewed. The main open questions that remain are concerned with the subsurface dynamics, including why sunspots emerge at preferred latitudes as seen in the familiar butterfly wings, why the cycle is about 11 years long, and why the sunspot groups emerge tilted with respect to the equator (Joy's law). Next, we turn to magnetic helicity, whose conservation property has been identified with the decline of large-scale magnetic fields found in direct numerical simulations at large magnetic Reynolds numbers. However, magnetic helicity fluxes through the solar surface can alleviate this problem and connect theory with observations, as will be discussed.},

This is used to study the relationship between rotation and stellar activity and derive a new estimate of the convective turnover time. From an unbiased subset of this sample the power-law slope of the unsaturated regime, LX
            /L
            bolâRoÎ², is fit as Î² = â2.70 Â± 0.13. This is inconsistent with the canonical Î² = â2 slope to a confidence of 5Ï, and argues for an additional term in the dynamo number equation. From a simple scaling analysis this implies ÎÎ©/Î©âÎ©0.7, i.e., the differential rotation of solar-type stars gradually declines as they spin down. Supersaturation is observed for the fastest rotators in our sample and its parametric dependencies are explored. Significant correlations are found with both the corotation radius and the excess polar updraft, the latter theory providing a stronger dependence and being supported by other observations. We estimate mass-dependent empirical thresholds for saturation and supersaturation and map out three regimes of coronal emission. Late F-type stars are shown never to pass through the saturated regime, passing straight from supersaturated to unsaturated X-ray emission. The theoretical threshold for coronal stripping is shown to be significantly different from the empirical saturation threshold (Ro < 0.13), suggesting it is not responsible. Instead we suggest that a different dynamo configuration is at work in stars with saturated coronal emission. This is supported by a correlation between the empirical saturation threshold and the time when stars transition between convective and interface sequences in rotational spin-down models.}

	abstract = {Synoptic measurements of activity in Sun-like stars have been performed continuously since 1966, and the largest set comes from the Mount Wilson HK project, in the form of the well-known S index. We have been monitoring the activity and variability of the Sun and a large sample of Sun-like stars, in terms of S and absolute flux, since 1994 with the Solar-Stellar Spectrograph (SSS) at Lowell Observatory. Directly inspired by the similar long-term program at Mount Wilson Observatory, the SSS incorporates both an HK spectrograph and an echelle for visible and far-red observations. This is the first of three papers presenting the results of some 20,000 observations of the Sun and Sun-like stars with the SSS. In this paper we describe our program, review the calibration of solar and stellar fluxes to S and the chromospheric emission fraction Râ²HK, compare our derived stellar activity measures to those from other programs, and discuss the broad characteristics of the activity and variability in our target set, with particular attention to good solar analogs and noncycling stars. In subsequent papers we will discuss the echelle data and present detailed examinations of stars of particular interest.}
