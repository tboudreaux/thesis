\section{\texttt{pyTOPSScrape}}\label{apx:pytopsscrape}
\texttt{pyTOPSScrape} provides an easy to use command line and python interface
for the OPLIB opacity tables accessed through the TOPS web form. Extensive
documentation of both the command line and programmatic interfaces is linked
in the version controlled repository. However, here we provide a brief,
illustrative, example of potential use.

Assuming \texttt{pyTOPSScrape} has been installed and given some working
directory which contains a file describing a base composition (``comp.dat'')
and another file containing a list of rescalings of that base composition
(``rescalings.dat'') (both of these file formats are described in detail in the
documentation), one can query OPLIB opacity tables and convert them to a form
mimicking that of type 1 OPAL high temperature opacity tables using the
following shell command.

\begin{verbatim}
	$ generateTOPStables comp.dat rescalings.dat -d ./TOPSCache -o out.opac -j 20
\end{verbatim}
