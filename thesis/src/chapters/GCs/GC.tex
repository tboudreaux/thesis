\chapter{Why Study Globular Clusters}
Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest observable objects in the universe
\citep{Pen11}. They are characterized by high densities with typical half-light
radii of $\le$10 pc \citep{Vanderburg2010}, and typical masses ranging from
$10^{4}$--$10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ \citep{Bro06} --- though some GCs are
significantly larger than these typical values \citep[e.g. $\omega$Cen,
][]{Richer1991}. GCs provide a unique way to probe stellar evolution
\citep{Bau03}, galaxy formation models \citep{Boy18,Kra05}, and dark matter
halo structure \citep{Hud18}.

The traditional view of Globular Clusters was, for a long time, that they
consisted of a single stellar population (SSP, in some publications this is
referred to as a Simple Stellar Population). This view was supported by
spectroscopically uniform heavy element abundances \citep{Carretta2010, Bastian2018} accross most clusters (M54 and $\omega$Cen are notable exceptions, see \citet{Marino2015} for further details), and the lack of evidence for multiple stellar populations
(MPs) in past color-magnitude diagrams of GCs \citep[i.e.][]{Sandage1953, Alcaino1975}. However, over the last 40 years non-trivial star-to-star light-element abundance variations have been observed \citep[i.e.][]{Smith1987} and, in
the last two decades, it has been definitively shown that most if not all Milky
Way GCs have MPs \citep{Gratton2004, Gratton2012, Piotto2015}. The lack of photometric evidence for MPs
can be attributed to the short color throw available to ground based
photometric surveys \citep{Milone2017}; specifically, lacking UV filters. While MPs are chemically distinct
from one another, that distinction is most prominent when observing with $U$
and $B$ filters \citep{Sbordone2011}.

The prevalence of multiple populations in GCs is so distinct that the proposed
definitions for what constitutes a globular cluster now often center the
existence of MPs. Whereas, people have have often tried to categorized objects
as GCs through relations between half-light radius, density, and surface
brightness profile, in fact many objects which are generally thought of as GCs
don't cleanly fit into these cuts \citep{Peebles1968, Brown1991, Brown1995, Bekki2002}.
Consequently, \citet{Carretta2010} proposed a definition of GC based on
observed chemical inhomogeneities in their stellar populations. The modern
understanding of GCs then is not simply one of a dense cluster of stars which
may have chemical inhomogeneities and multiple populations; rather, it is one
where those chemical inhomogeneities and multiple populations themselves are
the defining element of a GC.

All Milky Way globular clusters older than 2 Gyr studied in detail show
populations enriched in He, N, and Na while also being deplete in O and C
\citep{Piotto2015,Bastian2018}. These light element abundance patterns also are
not strongly correlated with variations in heavy element abundance, resulting
in spectroscopically uniform Fe abundances between populations. Further,
high-resolution spectral studies reveal anti-correlations between N-C
abundances, Na-O abundances, and potentially Al-Mg \citep{Sneden1992,
Gratton2012}. Typical stellar fusion reactions can deplete core oxygen;
however, the observed abundances of Na, Al, and Mg cannot be explained by the
likes of the CNO cycle \citep{Prantzos2007}.

Formation channels for these multiple populations remain a point of debate
among astronomers. Most proposed formation channels consist of some older,
more massive, population of stars polluting the pristine cluster media before a
second population forms, now enriched in heavier elements which they themselves could
not have generated \citep[for a detailed review see ][]{Gratton2012}. The four
primary candidates for these polluters are asymptotic giant branch stars
\citep[AGBs,][]{Ventura2001,DErcole2010}, fast rotating massive stars
\citep[FRMSs,][]{Decressin2007}, super massive stars
\citep[SMSs,][]{Denissenkov2014}, and massive interacting binaries
\citep[MIBs,][]{deMink2009, Bastian2018}. 

Hot hydrogen burning (proton capture), material transport to the surface, and
material ejection into the intra-cluster media are features of each of these
models and consequently they can all be made to {\it qualitatively} agree with
the observed elemental abundances. However, none of the standard models can
currently account for all specific abundances \citep{Gratton2012}. AGB and FRMS
models are the most promising; however, both models have difficulty reproducing
severe O depletion \citep{Ventura2009,Decressin2007}. Moreover, AGB and FRMS
models require significant mass loss ($\sim 90\%$) between cluster formation
and the current epoch --- implying that a significant fraction of halo stars
formed in GCs \citep{Renzini2008,DErcole2008,Bastian2015}.

In addition to the light-element anti-correlations observed it is also known
that younger populations are significantly enhanced in Helium
\citep{Piotto2007, Piotto2015, Latour2019}. Depending on the cluster, Helium
mass fractions as high as $Y=0.4$ have been inferred \citep[e.g][]{Milone2015}.
However, due to the relatively high and tight temperature range of partial
ionization for He it cannot be observed in globular clusters; consequently, the
evidence for enhanced He in GCs originates from comparison of theoretical
stellar isochrones to the observed color-magnitude-diagrams of globular
clusters. Therefore, a careful handling of chemistry is essential when modeling
with the aim of discriminating between MPs; yet, only a very limited number of
GCs have yet been studied with chemically self-consistent (structure and
atmosphere) isochrones \citep[e.g.][NGC 6752]{Dotter2015}. 

\chapter{Modeling Globular Clusters}
Due to the importance of globular clusters accross domains of astronomy 
there are multiple ways to model them. Some of these approaches, for work
which is primarily focused on teh dynamics of clusters and galxies, treat
globular clusters as dynamical systems and study aspects such as evaporation rates
and dynamical cooling timescales. 

An analytic framework for understanding cluster evaporation was proposed by
both \citet{Amb38} and \citet{Spi40}, who suggested an expression for a
dimensionless evaporation rate $\xi$.
\begin{equation}
    \xi \equiv -\frac{t_{rh}}{M}\frac{dM}{dt}
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the total cluster mass and the relaxation time $t_{rh}$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    t_{rh} = \frac{0.14 N}{\ln\Lambda}\sqrt{\frac{r^{3}_{hm}}{GM}}
\end{equation}
Where $r_{hm}$ is the half mass radius of the cluster. Additionally, $\Lambda
\equiv 0.4N$ and N is the total number of stars in the cluster. Due to the
complexity of cluster mass evaporation, the initial attempts to analytically
constrain the value of $\xi$ have been superseded by numerical calculations. As
a result, it has since been shown that both external tidal fields \citep{Mad17,
Bau03} and stellar evolution \citep{Bau03} play important roles in determining
a cluster's mass loss rate.

Understanding the evaporation and expansion history of GCs can shed light on
both the galactic potentials in which the cluster lives, and where the cluster
formed in the galactic potential \citep{Ren17}. \citet{Wil03} and \citet{Gon05}
presented early evidence via numeric studies that the primordial binary
fraction of a cluster may influence a cluster's core radius expansion rate.
Their results show that a direct proportionality between the binary fraction
and core radius expansion rates may exist. Further, \citet{Lan07} provided
empirical evidence, through a study of blue straggler stars (BSS) in M5, that
collisional binaries may increase evaporation rates. However, there has yet to
be established a firm quantitative relationship between the primordial binary
fraction of a cluster and its evolutionary rates


\section{Problems Modeling Globular Clusters}
There are some outstanding problems in models of Globular Clusters, primarily
these fall into two categories. One, formation channels do not currently capture
the observed abundance variations between multiple populations in clusters. This
is espcecially pronounced when considering the timescale involved between early 
and later population formation.
