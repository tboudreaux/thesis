\section{The Red Giant Branch Bunch in NGC 2808}
NGC 2808 is made up of of anywhere from 2 - 5 separate stellar populations. In
Chapter \ref{chap:ngc2808} we discussed modeling efforts of the primordial
and the most enriched of these populations (A and E). Here we identify the
RGBB location in both populations and compare that to observations of the RGBB
luminosity.

Identification of the RGBB may be preformed with either isochrones or stellar
evolutionary tracks. For the same reasons laid out in \citet{Joyce2016} we use
evolutionary tracks in place of isochrones. This is primarily due to the
limited sampling of equivalent evolutionary points near the bump which can
result in the bump be interpolated over. 

We select two evolutionary tracks from the Population A (Y$\sim$0.24) and
Population E (Y $\sim$ 0.36) model sets each of a mass so that they reach the
red giant branch within 100 Myr of each other. The population A model is of
mass 0.857 M$_{\odot}$ while the population E model is of mass 0.625
M$_{\odot}$. Identification of the RGBB in the tracks is then straightforward.
First we preform bolometric corrections to take the tracks into WFC3/ACS
filters with the same distance modulus and extinction as we fit in Chapter
\ref{chap:ngc2808}, then we identify the maximum of the derivative of F814W
magnitude vs. age. This metric proves to reliably extract the center of the
RGBB. We identify the bump in population A at an F814W magnitude of approximately 16.5 while
we are unable to identify the gap in population E.

In order to verify this is a attribute of the population and not the particular
model we selected we preform stellar population synthesis using the best fit
isochrones from Chapter \ref{chap:ngc2808}. This is done using the population
synthesis module in \fidanka. Further, HUGS artificial star tests are used in
order to inject proper uncertainties and to model completeness. Figure
\ref{fig:LumFAE} shows both the synthetic population (left) and the luminosity
function of that population (right). We measure the magnitude of the RGBB by
first flattening the luminosity function shown in Figure \ref{fig:LumFAE} with
a second order polynomial. We then fit a Gaussian model --- with a prior of
16.5 as the mean of the RGBB magnitude --- to the flattened luminosity function.
We find that the RGBB in population A is located at F814W = 16.53$\pm$0.004
mag, this is in agreement with literature values for the magnitude of the RGBB
in NGC 2808. However, once again we do not see a bump in the synthetic
population E data. The pertinent question then becomes why do we not see a
RGBB in population E when compared to population A.

\subsection{Population E and the Case of the Missing Bump}
It is well established that stars with lower metallicities will have a less
pronounced bump \citep{Cassisi2002, Bjork2006}. Population E in fact is
dramatically more depleted in general metallicity than population A ([Fe/H] =
-1.34 and [Fe/H] =-0.94 respectively). Lower metallicities decrease the opacity
of a star and therefore make the coupling between the radiation field and the
fluid field weaker. This results in less efficient thermal transfer into the
fluid of the star. This results in a more shallow outer convective zone
(Figures \ref{fig:convEnvMass} \& \ref{fig:MfracVX}) which may not be able mix
new hydrogen fuel deep enough to induce the RGBB. Specifically, in population E
we see that the convection zone only reaches down 50\% of the mass of the model
(Figure \ref{fig:MfracVX}). Because of this, shell burning does not reach the
discontinuity in hydrogen mass fraction until later in the model's life. Because
the luminosity of the models is rapidly increasing during this phase of
evolution the timescales to burn hydrogen shrink rapidly as well. Therefore, in
population E even though there does seem to be a small discontinuity in the
hydrogen mass fraction, evolutionary time scales are so short that the
population will evolve through this period without a noticeable bump. The lack
of an observed RGB bump in Population E models --- and the commensurate lack of
effect that population E has on the location of the NGC 2808 bump --- validates
previous theoretical investigations of the bump which have ignored the presence
of multiple populations in NGC 2808 while modeling the bump.

  reaches approximately 60 percent of the star by mass while the population E

    does. Populations have been roughly mas calibrated so they reach the same
    evolutionary stages within 100 Myr of each other.}
