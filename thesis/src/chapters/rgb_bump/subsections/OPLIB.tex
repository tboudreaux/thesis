\section{Effects of Opacities on the Red Giant Branch Bump}
In addition to models of multiple populations in NGC 2808, we also have access
to GS98 solar composition models using OPAL and Ferguson opacities as well as
models using OPLIB and Aesopus opacities (high and low temperature
respectively). Given the RGB bumps sensititvity to convective zone depth, as
demonstrated in the previous section, it is reasonable to assume that
variations in the opacity may have an effect on its location. 

Following the procedure outlined in \citep{Joyce2016} we identify the RGB Bump
in models evolved over an [Fe/H] grid of -2.0, -1.8, -1.6, -1.4, -1.2, -1.0,
and -0.8. All models use a GS98 solar composition, high temperature opacities
from OPLIB and low temperature opacities from Aesopus. Models are evolved with
a typical numerical tolerance of one part in 10$^{5}$ and include gravitational
settling. All other model parameters are the same as outlined in Chapter \ref{chap:ngc2808}. 

The evolutionary tracks for each model are bolometrically corrected into
UBV(RI)c filters using the bolometric correction tables provided by MIST
\citep{Choi2016} and \fidanka. These bolometric corrections additionally assume $\mu =
0$ and $A_{v} = 0$. The magnitude of the bump is then defined as the magnitude
at the age where the magnitude-age derivative is maximized. We visually inspect
all models to confirm that the identified magnitude aligns with the location of
the bump.

Comparing bump locations between OPAL+Ferguson opacities (Figure
\ref{fig:OPALvsOPLIBRGBB}) to OPLIB+Aesopus opacities we find that indeed the
updated opacities to effect the location of the bump; however, this is a very
small effect, on the order of a few parts in 100. Given that the updated
opacities have such a small effect on the RGBB location, and do not resolve the
discrepancies seen in \citet{Joyce2016} we do not believe that a more detailed
investigation of the effects opacity have on RGBB location in warranted.

  magnitudes; however, this is a very weak effect.}
