NGC 2808 is the prototype globular cluster to host Multiple Populations.
Various studies since 2007 have identified that it may host anywhere from 2-5
stellar populations. These populations have been identified both
spectroscopically \citep[i.e.][]{} and photometrically \citep[i.e.][]{}. Note
that recent work \citep{Valle2022} calls into question the statistical
significance of the detections of more than 2 populations in the spectroscopic
data. Here we present new, chemically self-consistent modeling of the
photometry of the two extreme populations of NGC 2808 identified by
\citet{Milone2015}, populations A and E. We use archival photometry from the
Hubble UV Globular Cluster Survey (HUGS) \citep{Piotto2015, Milone2017} in the
F275W and F814W passbands to charecterize multiple populations in NGC 2808
\citep{Milone2015, Milone2015b}. Additionally, we present a likelihood analysis of the
photometric data of NGC 2808 to determine the number of populations present in
the cluster.
