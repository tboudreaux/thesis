\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:2808conclusion}
Here we have performed the first chemically self-consistent modeling of the
Milky Way Globular Cluster NGC 2808. We find that, updated atmospheric boundary
conditions and opacity tables do not have a significant effect on the inferred
helium abundances of multiple populations. Specifically, we find that
population  has a helium mass fraction of 0.24, while population E has a helium
mass fraction of 0.39. Additionally, we find that the ages of these two
populations agree within uncertainties but with a slight bias towrds population
A being older. We only find evidence for two distinct stellar populations,
which is in agreement with recent work studying the number of populations in
NGC 2808 spectroscopic data.

The tooling we have developed for fidanka provides a robust and efficient means
to estimate ages of multiple populations for any globular cluster. Future work
may make use of this to investigate whether there is a consistent bias in the age
distribution of multiple populations in milky way globular clusters.

We introduce a new software suite for globular cluster science,
\fidanka, which has been released under a permissive open source license.
\fidanka aims to provide a statistically robust set of tools for estimating the
parameters of multiple populations within globular clusters.
