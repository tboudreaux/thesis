\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Here we have preformed the first chemically self-consistnent modeling of the
Milky Way Globular Cluster NGC 2808. We find that, updated atmospheric boundary
conditions and opacity tables do not have a significant effect on the inferred
helium abundances of multiple populations. Specifically, we find that the older
stellar population, populatio A, has a helium mass fraction of 0.24, while the
older population, E, has a helum mass fraction of 0.39.

Further, we introduce a new software suite for globular cluster science,
\fidanka, which has been released under a permissive open source liscense.
\fidanka aims to provide a statistically robust set of tools for estimating the
parameters of multiple populations within globular clusters.
