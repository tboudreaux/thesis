\section{Magnetic Activities in M dwarfs Closing Thoughts}\label{sec:magActivity-conclusions}
In this work we have approximately doubled the number of M-dwarfs with both
empirically measured $R'_{HK}$ with $M_{*} < 0.5 M_{\odot}$. This has enabled
us to more precisely constrain the rotation-activity relation. This
relationship is consistent with other measurements using $R'_{HK}$, and
$L_{X}$/$L_{bol}$; our data does not require a slope in the saturated regime.
Finally, we identify a mass dependence in the activity level of the saturated
regime, consistent with trends seen in more massive stars in previous works.
