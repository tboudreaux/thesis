%% This is a sample manuscript marked up using the
%% AASTeX v6.2 LaTeX 2e macros.
%%
%% AASTeX is now based on Alexey Vikhlinin's emulateapj.cls 
%% (Copyright 2000-2015).  See the classfile for details.

%% AASTeX requires revtex4-1.cls (http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/) and
%% other external packages (latexsym, graphicx, amssymb, longtable, and epsf).
%% All of these external packages should already be present in the modern TeX 
%% distributions.  If not they can also be obtained at www.ctan.org.

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v6.x document is the \documentclass
%% command. LaTeX will ignore any data that comes before this command. The 
%% documentclass can take an optional argument to modify the output style.
%% The command below calls the preprint style  which will produce a tightly 
%% typeset, one-column, single-spaced document.  It is the default and thus
%% does not need to be explicitly stated.

\begin{abstract}
In the canonical theory of stellar magnetic dynamo, the tachocline in partially
	convective stars serves to arrange small-scale fields, generated by
	stochastic movement of plasma into a coherent large-scale field.
	Mid-to-late M-dwarfs, which are fully convective, show more magnetic
	activity than classical magnetic dymano theory predicts. However,
	mid-to-late M-dwarfs show tight correlations between rotation and magnetic
	activity, consistent with elements of classical dynamo theory. We use data
	from Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) Spectrograph to detail the
	relation between Ca II H\&K flux and rotation period for these low-mass
	stars. We measure $R'_{HK}$ values for 53 spectroscopically identified
	M-dwarfs selected from the MEarth survey; these stars span spectral classes
	from M5.0 to M3.5 and have rotation periods ranging from hours to months.
	We present the rotation--activity relationship as traced through these
	data. We find power law and saturated regimes consistent to within one
	sigma of previously published results and observe a mass dependence in
	R'$_{HK}$.

\bibliography{ms}
%% To help institutions obtain information on the effectiveness of their 
%% telescopes the AAS Journals has created a group of keywords for telescope 
%% facilities.
%
%% Following the acknowledgments section, use the following syntax and the
%% \facility{} or \facilities{} macros to list the keywords of facilities used 
%% in the research for the paper.  Each keyword is check against the master 
%% list during copy editing.  Individual instruments can be provided in 
%% parentheses, after the keyword, but they are not verified.



%% Similar to \facility{}, there is the optional \software command to allow 
%% authors a place to specify which programs were used during the creation of 
%% the manusscript. Authors should list each code and include either a
%% citation or url to the code inside ()s when available.



%% Appendix material should be preceded with a single \appendix command.
%% There should be a \section command for each appendix. Mark appendix
%% subsections with the same markup you use in the main body of the paper.

%% Each Appendix (indicated with \section) will be lettered A, B, C, etc.
%% The equation counter will reset when it encounters the \appendix
%% command and will number appendix equations (A1), (A2), etc. The
%% Figure and Table counter will not reset.



%% The reference list follows the main body and any appendices.
%% Use LaTeX's thebibliography environment to mark up your reference list.
%% Note \begin{thebibliography} is followed by an empty set of
%% curly braces.  If you forget this, LaTeX will generate the error
%% "Perhaps a missing \item?".
%%
%% thebibliography produces citations in the text using \bibitem-\cite
%% cross-referencing. Each reference is preceded by a
%% \bibitem command that defines in curly braces the KEY that corresponds
%% to the KEY in the \cite commands (see the first section above).
%% Make sure that you provide a unique KEY for every \bibitem or else the
%% paper will not LaTeX. The square brackets should contain
%% the citation text that LaTeX will insert in
%% place of the \cite commands.

%% We have used macros to produce journal name abbreviations.
%% \aastex provides a number of these for the more frequently-cited journals.
%% See the Author Guide for a list of them.

%% Note that the style of the \bibitem labels (in []) is slightly
%% different from previous examples.  The natbib system solves a host
%% of citation expression problems, but it is necessary to clearly
%% delimit the year from the author name used in the citation.
%% See the natbib documentation for more details and options.


%% This command is needed to show the entire author+affilation list when
%% the collaboration and author truncation commands are used.  It has to
%% go at the end of the manuscript.

%% Include this line if you are using the \added, \replaced, \deleted
