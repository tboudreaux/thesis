%% This is a sample manuscript marked up using the
%% AASTeX v6.2 LaTeX 2e macros.
%%
%% AASTeX is now based on Alexey Vikhlinin's emulateapj.cls 
%% (Copyright 2000-2015).  See the classfile for details.

%% AASTeX requires revtex4-1.cls (http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/) and
%% other external packages (latexsym, graphicx, amssymb, longtable, and epsf).
%% All of these external packages should already be present in the modern TeX 
%% distributions.  If not they can also be obtained at www.ctan.org.

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v6.x document is the \documentclass
%% command. LaTeX will ignore any data that comes before this command. The 
%% documentclass can take an optional argument to modify the output style.
%% The command below calls the preprint style  which will produce a tightly 
%% typeset, one-column, single-spaced document.  It is the default and thus
%% does not need to be explicitly stated.

% \begin{abstract}
% 	The traditional view of globular clusters is that they contain a single,
% 	old, populations of stars. However, over the last 20 years, because of high
% 	resolution Hubble photometry, almost every globular cluster in orbit of the
% 	milky way has been observed to have multiple stellar populations. It is
% 	believed that these are separated in helium enhancement. However, due to
% 	its relatively high temperature partial ionization zone Helium is not
% 	directly observable in globular clusters; consequently, this belief is
% 	based on modeling. Current generation stellar models do not
% 	self-consistently model helium enhancement, failing to enhance both the
% 	atmosphere and interior structure simultaneously. Here we present a new
% 	generation of Dartmouth Stellar Evolution models, ranging in mass from 0.3
% 	to 2 solar masses, which, for the first time, self consistently model
% 	helium enhancement from the stellar interior all the way out to and
% 	including the stellar atmosphere.
