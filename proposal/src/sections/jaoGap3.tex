Where the project laid out in \S \ref{sec:p2} study the feasibility of using the
Jao Gap to date stellar populations; this project will apply this technique to
observational data. Specifically, we measure the Jao Gap location in populations
separated by gyro-kinematic age-dating in the solar neighboorhood.
