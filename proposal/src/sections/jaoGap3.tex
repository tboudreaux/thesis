Where the project laied out in \S \ref{sec:p2} study the feasibility of using the
Jao Gap to date stellar populations; this project will apply this tequnique to
observational data. Specifically, we measure the Jao Gap location in populations
seperated by gyro-kinematic dataing in the solar neighboorhood.
