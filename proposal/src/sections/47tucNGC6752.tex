In addition to NGC 2808, collaborators will generate MARCS atmospheric models for the
clusters NGC 6752 and 47 Tuc. Using these surface boundary conditions along
with new opacity tables we query from OPLIB, we will conduct the same,
self-consistent, modeling for these clusters as we do for NGC 2808.

NGC 6752 has been self-consistently modeled in past. \citet{Dotter2015} perform
self-consistent chemical modeling of this cluster using both ATLAS and PHOENIX
atmospheric boundary conditions computed from abundance of the photometrically
identified poulations A and C reported by \citet{Milone2013}.
\citeauthor{Dotter2015} additionally make use of OPAL high temperature opacity
tables and PHOENIX low temperature opacity tables. {\color{red}[Detail on what Dotter Found]}
