Following the integration of updated high temperature opacities detiled in \S
\ref{sec:p1} we will investigate using the Jao-Gap color to age the local
solar neighboorhood.

Models predict that the location of the Jap Gap will shift with population age
[CITATION]; in fact, we see this behavior, gap colors reddening as populations
age, in populations evolved with DSEP [FIGURE] which span the mass range of the
gap.

[DETAILS ON KINEMATIC AGEING]

We propose to model a population of stars of various ages and mettalicities
sampled from the local stellar neighboorhood. Each of these stars will be
assigned kinematics --- again sampled from empirical distributions. We will
then extract kinematically derived ages from this population and use these to
segregate stars into rough age bins. Finally, we will measure if difference in
Jao gap locations are statistically distinquishable between these rough age bins.
