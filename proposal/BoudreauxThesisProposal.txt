Abstract
Over its approximately 100 year history stellar modeling has become an essential
tool for understanding certain astrophysical phenomena which are not directly observable. Modeling allows for empirical constraints — such as elemental abundances,
luminosities, and effective temperatures — to strongly inform non-observables such
a core temperature and pressure. Here we propose a thesis in five parts, related
through their use of both modeling and the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program
(DSEP) to conduct this modeling. In two of the parts of this thesis we will use DSEP,
in conjunction with atmospheric boundary conditions generated by collaborators, to
build chemically self-consistent models of multiple populations (MPs) in the globular clusters NGC 2808, 47 Tuc, and NGC 6752. We will infer helium abundances
across MPs and compare these inferred abundances to those from models which do
not consider as careful a handling of a star’s chemistry. The remaining three parts
of this thesis will address a recently discovered feature in the Gaia GBP − GRP colormagnitude-diagram (colloquially the Jao Gap). Throughout this series we will update
DSEP’s high-temperature opacity tables to the most modern available (OPLIB from
Los Alamos) and show how this change affects the theoretical location of the Jao Gap.
Subsequently, we will use synthetic color-magnitude-diagrams (CMDs) — covering the
Jao Gap regime — in conjunction with gyro-kinematically derived age distributions
to test the feasibility of population age-dating by measuring the Jao Gap’s location
in a CMD. Finally, we will apply techniques developed in our theoretical testing of
Jao Gap based age-dating to the solar neighborhood, attempting to identify coeval
groups and roughly age-date them. These five parts will compose the scientific chapters of a thesis to be submitted to the faculty and advising committee no later than
the summer term of 2024.

1. INTRODUCTION

Throughout last half of the 19th and first decade of the 20th centuries Lane, Ritter, and Emden codified the earliest mathematical model of stellar structure, the polytrope (Equation 1), in
Gaskugeln (Gas Balls) (Emden 1907).

Where ξ and θ are dimensionless parameterizations of radius and temperature respectively, and n is
known as the polytropic index. Despite this early work, it wasn’t until the late 1930s and early 1940s
that the full set of equations needed to describe the structure of a steady state, radially-symmetric,
star (known as the equations of stellar structure) began to take shape as proton-proton chains and
the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen cycle were, for the first time, seriously considered as energy generation
mechanisms (Cowling 1966). Since then, and especially with the proliferation of computers in
astronomy, the equations of stellar structure have proven themselves an incredibly predictive set of
models.
There are currently many stellar structure codes (e.g. Dotter et al. 2008; Kovetz et al. 2009;
Paxton et al. 2011) which integrate the equations of stellar structure — in addition to equations
of state and lattices of nuclear reaction rates — over time to track the evolution of an individual
star. The Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program (DSEP) (Chaboyer et al. 2001; Bjork & Chaboyer
2006; Dotter et al. 2008) is one such, well tested, stellar evolution program.
Here we propose to model low-mass stars in both the local solar neighborhood and in globular
clusters using DSEP. This work will primarily extend our understanding of stellar physics in two
areas: the effects of chemical self-consistency on stellar models (e.g. Dotter et al. 2015) and the time
evolution of the core-convective instabilities which ultimately are believed to result in the observed
paucity of stars at a Gaia G magnitude of ∼10 (Jao et al. 2018; Feiden et al. 2021).
1.1. Globular Clusters

4

Boudreaux et al.

Figure 1. mpg - mpv color-magnitude diagram for the globular cluster M3.

Globular clusters (GC, Herschel 1814) are among the oldest groupings of stars in the universe,
with typical ages greater than 10 Gyr. They are characterized by their compact size — typical halflight radius < 10 pc but up to 10s of pc — and high surface brightness — MV ∼ −7. For decades,
prevailing thought had it that globular clusters were composed of a single stellar population born
from a pristine media. Single stellar populations had been assumed, as opposed to multiple stellar
population (MPs), due to spectroscopically uniform iron abundances (Gratton et al. 2012) and very
narrow principal sequences (e.g. Figure 1 taken from Sandage 1953; Stetson & Harris 1988), both
of which are indicative of a single stellar population.
These early studies either did not handle — or had very large — photometric uncertainties,
masking subtly distinguished features within the CMD. Moreover, given these studies were ground
based they were limited to optical bands where colors do not respond strongly to all chemical
changes within a star’s atmosphere (molecular water lines, which UV and IR colors will more
strongly respond too, are of particular interest).

Despite the canonical view of single populations composing GCs, there has been spectroscopic
evidence for chemical inhomogeneities in GCs since the early 1970s (e.g. Osborn 1971) and by the
late 1980s, as higher resolution photometry became available, multiple clusters were known which
exhibited features in their CMDs consistent with either bimodal or multimodal stellar populations
(e.g. Norris 1987).
The first conclusive evidence for MPs came with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) high precision
crowded field photometry in which three distinct main sequences in NGC 2808 were identified
(Piotto et al. 2007). Since this discovery, split main sequences have been found in nearly all Milky
Way globular clusters studied by HST (Anderson et al. 2009; Milone et al. 2012). Split stellar
populations are believed to be due to enhanced helium abundances, with signifigant observed starto-star light-element abundance variation, in their stellar populations formed after the primordial
population of stars (D’Antona et al. 2005; Piotto et al. 2007). When compared to primordial
helium mass fractions (Y ) of Y ∼ 0.25 (Collaboration et al. 2016) or solar helium abundances
Y ∼ 0.27 (Vinyoles et al. 2017) these populations have mass fractions as high as Y ∼ 0.4. Helium
enhancement is strongly suspected to be the result of an earlier, more massive population dying
off, enriching the interstellar medium (Gratton et al. 2001, 2004, 2012); however, precise formation
channels for split stellar populations remain contentious.
Two chapters of this thesis will further constrain the helium enhancement of MPs within globular
clusters by modeling their stellar populations in a fully chemically self-consistent manner. Sections
2.4 and 2.5 address the details of these projects in more detail.

1.2. Local Solar Neighborhood
Jao et al. (2018) discovered a novel feature in the Gaia GBP − GRP color-magnitude-diagram.
Around MG = 10 there is an approximately 17% decrease in stellar density of the sample of stars
Jao et al. considered. Subsequently, this has become known as either the Jao Gap, or Gaia M
dwarf Gap. Section 2.1 will go into more detail regarding the physics underpinning this feature;
however, in brief convective instabilities in the core are believed to form for stars straddling the fully

6

Boudreaux et al.

convective transition mass. These instabilities result in stars’ luminosities preferentially evolving
either slightly brighter or dimmer than the mass-luminosity relation around the convective transition
mass would naively indicate (Jao & Feiden 2020).
The Jao Gap, inherently a feature of M dwarf populations, provides an enticing and unique
view into the interior physics of these stars (Feiden et al. 2021). This is especially important as,
unlike more massive stars, M dwarf seismology is currently infeasible due to the short periods and
extremely small magnitude’s which both radial and low-order low-degree non-radial seismic waves
are predicted to have in such low mass stars (Rodrı́guez-López 2019). The Jao Gap therefore
provides one of the only current methods to probe the interior physics of M dwarfs.
Stellar modeling has been successful in reproducing the Jao Gap (e.g. Feiden et al. 2021; Mansfield
& Kroupa 2021) and, with these models, we have begun to understand which parameters constrain
the Jao Gap’s location. For example, it is now well documented that metallicity affects the Jao
Gap’s color, with higher metallicity stellar populations showing the Jao Gap at consistently higher
masses / bluer colors (Mansfield & Kroupa 2021).
Initial testing we have done using DSEP along with articles from both Feiden et al. and Mansfield
& Kroupa indicated the Jao Gap’s location sensitivity to age, evolving to higher mass regions of the
mass-luminosity relation with population age. Per Mansfield & Kroupa (2021) the degree of this
location evolution also does not seem to be strongly sensitive to metallicity. Sections 2.2 and 2.3
of this proposal lay out a plan to use this observed age-dependence to age-date gyro-kinematically
separated populations [Q for E: populations or sub sets...?] in the solar neighborhood.
2. THESIS STRUCTURE

The thesis here proposed will be split into five scientific chapters plus an introduction. Each
scientific chapter will consist of work focusing on models of low mass stars.
2.1. Jao Gap & Updated High Temperature Opacities
Due to initial mass requirements of the molecular clouds which collapse to form stars, star formation is strongly biased towards lower mass, later spectral class stars when compared to higher mass

stars. Partly as a result of this bias and partly as a result of their extremely long main-sequence
lifetimes, M-dwarfs make up approximately 70 percent of all stars in the galaxy. Moreover, some
planet search campaigns have focused on M-dwarfs due to the relative ease of detecting small planets in their habitable zones (e.g. Nutzman & Charbonneau 2008). M-dwarfs then represent both
a key component of the galactic stellar population as well as the possible set of stars which may
host habitable exo-planets. Given this key location M-dwarfs occupy in modern astronomy it is
important to have a thorough understanding of their structure and evolution.
2.1.1. Observations and Instability
Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) revealed a previously unknown structure in in the GBP − GRP , MG
color-magnitude diagram (Figure 2) corresponding to stars with a mass near that where a star
transitions from fully convective to having both convective and radiative regions within (the fully
convective transition mass — 0.3 to 0.35 M ) (Jao et al. 2018; Baraffe & Chabrier 2018). The
so-called Gaia M-dwarf gap, or Jao Gap, represents a decrease in luminosity and commensurately
a decrease in stellar density — by approximately 17% — over this mass range.
A theoretical explanation for such a density deficiency comes from van Saders & Pinsonneault
(2012), who propose that in a star directly above the transition mass, due to asymmetric production
and destruction of He3 during the proton-proton I chain (ppI), periodic luminosity variations can
be induced. This process is known as convective-kissing instability. Such a star will descend the
pre-MS with a radiative core; however, as the star reaches the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) and
as the core temperature exceeds 7 × 106 K, enough energy will be produced by the ppI chain that
the core becomes convective. At this point the star exists with both a convective core and envelope,
in addition to a thin, radiative, layer separating the two. Subsequently, asymmetries in ppI affect
the evolution of the star’s convective core.
The proton-proton I chain constitutes three reactions
1. p + p −→ d + e+ + νe
2. p + d −→

3. 3 He +3 He −→

3

He + 2p

Because reaction 3 of ppI consumes 3 He at a slower rate than it is produced by reaction 2, 3 He
abundance increases in the core increasing energy generation. The core convective zone will therefore
expand as more of the star becomes unstable to convection. This expansion will continue until
the core connects with the convective envelope. At this point convective mixing can transport
material throughout the entire radius of the star and the high concentration of 3 He will rapidly
diffuse outward, away from the core, again decreasing energy generation as reaction 3 slows down.
Ultimately, this leads to the convective region around the core pulling back away from the convective
envelope, leaving in place the radiative transition zone, at which point 3 He concentrations build up
in the core until it once again expands to meet the envelope. This process repeats until chemical
equilibrium is reached throughout the star and the core can sustain high enough nuclear reaction
rates to maintain contact with the envelope, resulting in a fully convective star.

2.1.2. Modeling the Gap
Since the identification of the Gaia M-dwarf gap, stellar modeling has been conducted to better
constrain its location, effects, and exact cause. Both Mansfield & Kroupa (2021) and Feiden et al.
(2021) identify that the gap’s mass location is correlated with model metallicity — the massluminosity discontinuity in lower metallicity models being at a commensurately lower mass. Feiden
et al. (2021) suggests this dependence is due to the steep relation of the radiative temperature
gradient, ∇rad , on temperature and in turn, on stellar mass.

∇rad ∝

Lκ
T4

(2)

As metallicity decreases so does opacity, which, by Equation 2, dramatically lowers the temperature where radiation will dominate energy transport (Chabrier & Baraffe 1997). Since main
sequence stars are virialized the core temperature is proportional to the core density and total mass
(Equation 3). Therefore, if the core temperature where convective-kissing instability is expected
decreases with metallicity, so too will the mass of stars which experience such instabilities.

Tc ∝ ρc M 2

(3)

This strong opacity dependence presents a slight problem where modeling is concerned. With
current computational tools it is infeasible to compute opacities on the fly; rather, Rossland Mean
opacity (κR ) for individual elements must be pre-tabulated over a wide range of temperatures and
densities. These opacities can then be somewhat arbitrarily mixed together and interpolated to
form opacity lookup-tables. Multiple groups have performed these calculations and subsequently
made tables available to the wider community, these include the Opacity Project (OP Seaton et al.
1994), Laurence Livermore National Labs OPAL opacity tables (Iglesias & Rogers 1996), and Los
Alamos National Labs OPLIB opacity tables (Colgan et al. 2016).
The OPAL opacity tables in particular are very widely used by current generation stellar evolution
programs (in addition to current generation stellar model and isochrone grids). However, they are

no longer the most up-to-date elemental opacities or numerically precise. Moreover, the generation
mechanism for these tables, a webform, is no longer reliably online.
Given its strong theoretical opacity dependence, it is reasonable to expect updated opacity tables
to affect, the Jap Gap’s mass range. Therefore, as part of this project we have transitioned DSEP
from OPAL high temperature opacities to opacities based on measurements from Los Alamos national Labs T-1 group (OPLIB Colgan et al. 2016). This chapter in the thesis will detail the opacity
transition, provide validation of the new opacity tables, and conduct an in-depth statistical comparison between the locations of Jao Gaps from populations modeled using both OPAL and OPLIB
opacities.
Preliminary work shows populations modeled with OPLIB opacities have Jao Gaps at consistently
lower masses / redder colors than those modeled using OPAL opacities (Figure 3 and Table 1). This
is in line with expectations based on OPLIB opacities begin uniformly lower than OPAL opacities
for temperature above 106 K (Figure 4) — with the lower opacities requiring commensurately lower
core temperatures before radiation dominates energy transport.

Following the integration of updated high temperature opacities detailed in §2.1, we will investigate
using the observed color and magnitude range of the Jao Gap to age-date coeval populations within
the solar neighboorhood.
While low-mass stars provide the majority of the fitting points for isochrones when estimating
ages of clusters, due to the very slow variations in observables during main sequence evolution, it
remains challenging to measure precise and accurate ages for low mass field stars (Soderblom 2010;

12

Boudreaux et al.

Veyette & Muirhead 2018; Kiman et al. 2021). Moreover, the extremely high density of isochrones
near the ZAMS, can result in uncertaninties on isochrone age estimates for K and M dwarfs as high
as 50 % (Lu et al. 2021). As a result of these high isochrone age uncertaninties other methods
of dating non-cluster populations have been developed, including age-calibrated rotation-activity
relations (e.g. Kiman et al. 2021) and gyro-kinematic age-dating (e.g. Lu et al. 2021). In this
chapter of the thesis we will present both a method of calibrating a Jao Gap location – age relation
alongside a study of why a population’s Jao Gap location evolves with age.
Both preliminary modeling and literature (e.g. Jao et al. 2018; Jao & Feiden 2020; Feiden et al.
2021; Mansfield & Kroupa 2021) demonstrate that the Jao Gap is expected to migrate along the
main sequence as a population of stars age. Our modeling indicates that stellar populations younger
than ∼ 2 Gyr do not show a gap. However, once the gap forms it will migrate towards bluer portions
of the CMD with age.
For this proposal we do not perform any rigorous statistical testing of whether the differences in
theoretical Jao Gap location could be discrimated between in observational data; instead, choosing
to save that element of the research for thesis work proper. However, we do perform a qualitative
test of the visual distinguisability of the Jao Gap location for two sample sizes — 500 and 1000
stars (Figure 5).

effective temperatures, and luminosities are transformed into Gaia magnitudes using bolometric

by first transforming G, BP , and RP flux and flux uncertaninty measurments for all sources
Gaia DR3 reports within 10pc to magnitude and magnitude uncertaninties. Flux errors do not
transform into symetric magnitude errors; however, for small uncertainties the transformation may
be approximated as symmetric (Equations 5 & 6).

Where x is the band of interest, Ix is the measured flux in that band, and ZPx is the zero
point offset in VEGAMAG. Following this transformation, we fit a second-order polynominal to the
magnitude error v.s. magnitude for each band. This polynominal gives an approximation of the
mean uncertaninty for a given magnitude. For each synthetic star’s magnitudes, sampled from the
evolved model grid, we add a sample from a normal distribution centered at 0 and with a standard
deviation equal to the evaluation of the optimized quadradic at that point’s magnitude.
Figure 5 Panels A and B show (1 Gyr) do not show any visible Jao Gap; whereas, Panels C, D, E,
and F all do. Moreover, the location of the Gap visiblly shifts to lower magnitudes from 3 Gyr to 6
Gyrs. Note that this shift is apparent in CMDs with both 1000s stars and those with 500 stars. In
fact, visually, this shift is clear with CMDs containing as few as 100 stars within the modeled color
range. The Gaia Catalouge of Nearby Stars (NBS) comprises a subset of all Gaia sources within
100 pc, it has been cleaned of spurious sources and is 92% complete for stars earlier than M9 with
completness dropping off for later spectral classes at the same distance (Gaia Collaboration et al.
2021). Querying the NBS yields 7654 sources within a tight color and magnitude band around the
Jao Gap’s expected location. Obviously, a simple visual identification is prone to confirmation bias;
however, given both the visual clear shift in our preliminary modeling along with the volumn of
empirical data Gaia provides, we believe that a more rigorous study is warrented.

Gap at 3 population ages and with different sample sizes. The superimposed color map is derived from a
Gaussian kernel-density-estimation run on the displayed points. This is included to better illustrate the
gap location.

Identifying the Jao Gap’s location one part of this work, another part is to tie these shifts in gap
location to established age proxies — that is we need to calibrate the Jao Gap’s age sensitivity.
We propose to model a population of stars of various ages and mettalicities sampled from the solar
neighboorhood. Each of these stars will be assigned kinematics — again sampled from empirical
distributions (Figure 6, Lu et al. 2021). We will then extract kinematically derived ages from this
population and use these to segregate stars into rough age bins. We will measure if difference in Jao
Gap locations are statistically distinquishable between these rough age bins, allowing us to extract
the a priori ages.

Where the project laid out in §2.2 will study the feasibility of using the Jao Gap to date stellar
populations; this project will apply this technique to observational data.
Lu et al. (2021) provide a sample of 29,949 stars with gyro-kinematicaly derived age. We will slice
this sample into coarse age bins and use Gaia DR3 photometry within these age bins to located
the Jap Gap. The goal will be be to provide an independent, calibrated, population age – Jap Gap
location relation.
Our sample will be pulled from the NBS. It is known that the Jao Gap is observable in this sample
(Figure 17 in Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021); however, we are lest interested in if the gap shows up
at all and instead interested in if subsets of the population show the gap in different locations. Using
Gaia reported vertical velocity displacments and follwing methods from (Lu et al. 2021) [OTHERS
that just do kinematically seperated velocity] we will slice the NBS into rough age groups (e.g. < 2
Gyr, ≥ 2 and < 6 Gyr, and ≥ 6 Gyr) and then, following binning methods laied out in Jao et al.
(2018) we will measure the Jao Gap location for each group.

16

Boudreaux et al.

Both binarity and variations in metallicity will smear the Jao Gap. The Renormalised Unit Weight
Error (RUWE) reported by Gaia, which tracks excess astrometric noise, can be used to filter for
wide binaries with mass ratios near 1 [Adam Crafts]. Further, we can model populations assuming
an m dwarf binary fraction [Jen Winters Paper on local Binarity] to place bounds on gap and gap
shift detectability. Similarly we will adopt a metallicity function for the solar neighborhood (though
this is approximatly constant) (Holmberg et al. 2009) when modeling the gap to place bounds on
it and its shift detectability.

2.4. NGC 2808
Whereas, people have have often tried to categorized objects as GCs by making cuts along halflight radius, density, and surface brightness profile, in fact many objects which are generally thought
of as GCs don’t cleanly fit into these cuts. Consequently, Carretta et al. (2010) proposed a definition of GC based on observed chemical inhomogeneities in their stellar populations. The modern
understanding of GCs then is not simply one of a dense cluster of stars which may have chemical
inhomogeneities and multiple populations; rather, it is one where those chemical inhomogeneities
and multiple populations themselves are the defining element of a GC.
All globular clusters older than 2 Gyr studied in detail show populations enriched in He, N, and Na
while also being deplete in O and C (Piotto et al. 2015; Bastian & Lardo 2018). These light element
abundance patterns also are not strongly correlated with variations in heavy element abundances.
One consequence of this fact is the spectroscopically uniform Fe abundances mentioned in §1.1.
Further, high-resolution spectral studies reveal anti-correlations between N-C abundances, Na-O
abundances, and potentially Al-Mg (Sneden et al. 1992; Gratton et al. 2012). Typical stellar fusion
reactions can deplete core oxygen; however, the observed abundances of Na, Al, and Mg cannot be
explained by the likes of the CNO cycle (Prantzos et al. 2007).
Formation channels for these multiple populations remain a point of debate amoung astronomers.
Most proposed formation channels consist of some older, more massive, population of stars polluting
the pristine cluter media before a second population forms, now enriched in heavier elements they

Thesis Proposal

17

themselves could not have generated (for a detailed review see Gratton et al. 2012). The four
primary candidates for these polluters are asymtotic giant branch stars (AGBs, Ventura et al. 2001;
D’Ercole et al. 2010), fast rotating massive stars (FRMSs, Decressin et al. 2007), super massive
stars (SMSs, Denissenkov & Hartwick 2014), and massive interacing binaries (MIBs, de Mink et al.
2009; Bastian & Lardo 2018).
Hot hydrogen burning (proton capture), material transport to the surface, and material ejection
into the intra-cluster media are features of each of these models and consequently they can all
be made to qualitatively agree with the observed elemental abundances. However, none of the
standard models can currently account for all specific abundances (Gratton et al. 2012). AGB and
FRMS models are the most promising; however, both models have difficulty reproducing severe O
depletion (Ventura & D’Antona 2009; Decressin et al. 2007). Moreover, AGB and FRMS models
require signifigant mass loss (∼ 90%) between cluster formation and the current epoch — implying
that a signifigant fraction of halo stars formed in GCs (Renzini 2008; D’Ercole et al. 2008; Bastian
& Lardo 2015).
In addition to the light-element anti-correlations observed it is also known that younger populations are signifigantly enhanced in Helium (Piotto et al. 2007, 2015; Latour et al. 2019). Depending
on the cluster, Helium mass fractions as high as Y = 0.4 have been inferred (e.g Milone et al.
2015). However, due to the relatively high and tight temperature range of partial ionization for He
it cannot be observed in globular clusters; consequently, the evidence for enhanced He in GCs originates from comparison of theoretical stellar isochrones to the observed color-magnitude-diagrams
of globular clusters. Therefore, a careful handling of chemistry is essential when modeling with the
aim of discriminating between MPs; yet, only a very limited number of GCs have yet been studied
with chemically self-consistent (structure and atmosphere) isochrones (e.g. Dotter et al. 2015, NGC
6752).
This thesis will contain chapters where we expand the number of clusters which have been selfconsistently modeled. In this chapter we will focus on chemically self-consistent modeling of the
two extreme population of NGC 2808 identified by (Milone et al. 2015), A and E.

Boudreaux et al.

One key element of NGC 2808 modeling is the incorporation of new atmospheric models, generated from the MARCS grid of model atmospheres (Plez 2008), which match interior elemental
abundances. MARCS provides one-dimensional, hydrostatic, plane-parallel and spherical LTE atmopsheric models (Gustafsson et al. 2008). Members of our collaboration have generated atmosphic
models for populations A and E. Integration of these new model atmospheres into DSEP is ongoing.
[Q for B: Should I talk about the convective model MARCS uses? & Should I compare MARCS in
a paragraph to PHOENIX?]
2.4.1. Population Opacities
For similar reasons as discussed in §2.1 we conduct this research with OPLIB high-temperature
opacity tables as opposed to OPAL tables. One important difference between this work and Dotter
et al. (2015) is that we do not generate chemically self-consistent low temperature opacities as
(Dotter et al. 2015) do NGC 6752. Instead we shift the atmospheric fitting point deep enough into
the stars so that only the high temperature opacity tables need be consulted [Q for B: convective
matching?]. Specifically we drop the atmospheric fitting point from an optical depth of τ = 1 to
τ = 100.
These population have been studied in depth by Feiden and their chemical compositions were
determined in Milone et al. (2015) (see Table 2 in that paper). While we cannot yet evolve DSEP
models with these new boundary conditions, we can make a first pass investigation of the affect of
OPLIB opacities (Figure 7). Note how the models generated using OPLIB opacity tables have a
systematically lower luminosity. This discrepancy is consistent with the overall lower opacities of
the OPLIB tables.
2.4.2. Additional Consistency
The isochrones generally used to infer the degree of helium enhancements assume that convection
operates in the same manner in metal-poor stars as it does in the Sun. However, observations
from Kepler of metal-poor red giants (Bonaca et al. 2012; Tayar et al. 2017), in concert with
interferometric radius determination of the metal-poor sub-giant HD 140283 (Creevey et al. 2015),

have shown that the efficiency of convection changes with iron content. As the final portion of our
work to more carefully handle a stars chemistry, we will modify DSEP to capture this variation in
convective efficiency.

2.5. 47 Tuc & NGC 6752
In addition to NGC 2808, collaborators will generate MARCS atmospheric boundary conditions
for multiple populations within the clusters NGC 6752 and 47 Tuc. Using these surface boundary
conditions along with new opacity tables we query from OPLIB, we will conduct the same, selfconsistent, modeling for these clusters as we do for NGC 2808.
NGC 6752 has been self-consistently modeled in past. Dotter et al. (2015) perform self-consistent
chemical modeling of this cluster using both ATLAS and PHOENIX atmospheric boundary condi-

tions computed from abundance of the photometrically identified poulations A and C reported by
Milone et al. (2013). Dotter et al. additionally make use of OPAL high temperature opacity tables
and PHOENIX low temperature opacity tables.
Dotter et al. find slight difference between best fit ishcohrone to NGC 6752 populations A and
E Blue and UV synthetic CMDs, with ATLAS atmospheres preforming slightly better. Moreover,
they find that inferred helium abundacnce is sensative to atmospheric boundary conditions, with
ATLAS models showing stronger heliumn sensitivity than PHOENIX models.
We will replicate portions of the work Dotter et al. conduct on NGC 6752 and extend this work
to 47 Tuc. [Talk to Brian about MARCS – PHOENIX comparison]

3. THESIS TIMELINE

We propose a thesis in five parts. Hereafter, the papers which will form the chapters of the
thesis will be referred to P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5. These are enumerated in chronological order of
submission.
The first paper, P1, detailing work already done to update DSEP to OPLIB opacity tables and
the effects those new opacity tables have on the Jao Gap location will be submitted in the summer
of 2022. The primary outstanding work for P1 is to run population synthesis models as, observationally, the Jao Gap is observed in populations of stars.
P2 covering self consistent modeling of NGC 2808, will be submitted sometime between the start
of the fall 2022 term and the spring 2023 term. Per Section 2.4 much of the background work for
this paper has been completed and we are currently ramping up modeling efforts now that we have
atmospheric models in hand. P4, consisting of modeling of both 47 Tuc and NGC 6752 will follow
directly from this work. Given P4’s similarity to P2 we anticipate it will only take three terms to
submit, with an expected submission term of summer 2023.
P3 will be submitted in the spring of 2023. This paper will focus on modeling populations of low
mass stars in the local solar neighborhood in order to determine if the location of the Jao Gap in
the CMD may be used to date these populations. Work on this paper has not yet begun. Finally,

P5 will follow up on the theoretical work from the P3; gathering archival photometric data from
low-mass stars in the local solar neighborhood and comparing Jao Gap derived ages to ages derived
from the age-velocity-dispersion relation.
These five papers, in addition to an introductory chapter, will comprise a thesis to be defended
sometime in the Summer 2024 term.
