Subject: Jao Gap Project

Content:
The Jao Gap shifts on the mass luminosity relation depending on a number of
factors, age, metallicity, opacity, and perhaps rotation. This idea could
be reasonably broken out into two parts, a theoretical and an observational. 

	Theoretical:
		The Jao gap can shift (see above). Evolve a set of models to match the
		local solar neighborhood (variety of ages and metallicities). Assign
		each star kinematics. From these kinmematics back track rough ages in
		the same manner that is used to date stars kinematically in
		observations. See if the difference in Jao Gap location would be
		measurable between the roughly young and roughly old populations.
	Observational:
		If the theoretical project implies that the difference in Jao Gap
		locations would change to an extent that was noticeable then attempt
		to use Gaia data for all Mdwarfs within the solar neighborhood too 
		measure that change.
